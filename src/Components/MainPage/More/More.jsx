              West Bengal could take your breath away with its tourism-related
              assets alone. From remnants of the colonial era to fiery reds of
              Goddess Kali, the modern West Bengal has come a long way. Its
              capital city Kolkata is now one of the most popular cities that
              promise many opportunities. And not to mention popular tourist
              locations like Darjeeling, Murshidabad, and Kharagpur to which
              thousands flock every year for some respite from the city life.
              <br /> In the recent past, many have migrated to this vibrant
              state in search of jobs and culture, and that in turn witnessed
              the real estate market blooming much. Hence, for all of you
              planning to involve in rental transactions, KalaCoat brings you a

                Prepare the Rental Agreement Draft by adding personal details

              </li>
              <li>
                Review the prepared document and print it on Stamp paper of
                recommended value.

              <li>
                Place signatures of tenant, landlord, and two witnesses at
                designated places.
              </li>
              <li>
                Register the prepared agreement with the local Sub-Registrar
                office.

              Normally, the tenant and landlord discuss the clauses they wish to
              include and then approach a lawyer to do the drafting. The lawyer
              takes care of the Stamp paper and registration part most often.
              However, this method could be time-consuming and the charges for
              getting this done may vary according to what your lawyer of choice
              may charge. Now, you can prepare rental and lease agreements
              online, which is the fastest and the most economical method.

              Stamp Duty is a tax that is levied on documents for making them
              legally valid.
              <br /> In late 2012, West Bengal introduced e-Stamping facilities
              in 10 centers around Kolkata. However, the state is yet to switch
              to the e-Stamping system completely. This means that both e-Stamp
              paper and conventional Stamp paper are currently in use with the
              smaller cities still depending on the conventional Stamp papers
              completely.

              Registering a document deters fraud and also reveals all matters
              related to the property under question. It is also a way of
              authenticating that the people mentioned in a document are indeed
              the ones who created it and that not forgery has occurred. If
              registration is overlooked, the document will never be considered
              as valid evidence in court instead it will be considered as
              collateral evidence.
              <br /> You need to pay the appropriate registration charges in the
              Sub-Registrar office at the time of registering the deed. It
              varies from State to State and also according to each year’s rules
              of the Stamp Act by the respective State Governments.

            <span>Types Of Rental Agreements</span>
          </div>
          <div className="pList">
            <p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
              <strong>11-Month Rental Agreement</strong> – Typically used in
              most rental transactions, the 11-month rental agreement is one of
              the most commonly used rental agreements throughout the country.
              The term of the lease is 11 months following which both parties
              can choose to either renew it or end it. Registration and
              notarization are skipped most of the time as the term is less than
              a year.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
              <strong>Long Term Lease</strong> – Signed commonly for residential
              purposes, long-term leases have durations in years. They involve
              large sums of money to be paid upfront and this sum is often
              returned to the tenant at the end of term. They are less
              frequently used as compared to the 11-month rental agreement.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.3em" }}>
              <strong>Commercial Lease</strong>– Signed exclusively for business
              deals, commercial leases involve large sums of money and long
              periods of duration. Commercial leases have an agreement format
              that is quite different from that of residential rental
              agreements. They do not have a standard format as needs and
              clauses vary with the type of business.

            <span>Important Clauses To Include In Your Rental Agreement</span>

          <div className="pList">
            <p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
              Parties involved may know each other but that is no excuse to
              relax your rental agreement. Matters that are important to the
              deal must be spelled out in the contract to avoid future
              conflicts. Some such clauses are –
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
              <strong>
                Monthly rent, security deposit & maintenance charges:
              </strong>
              Values for each much be clearly mentioned in the contract to avoid
              ugly spats. The frequency of payments must also be mentioned.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.3em" }}>
              <strong>Lock-in period:</strong>Lock-in period: The minimum
              duration for which either party cannot terminate the rental
              agreement is called the Lock-in period. This ensures that neither
              party backs out soon after the move is made and thereby incurs
              losses to the other party. The duration of the lock-in period must
              be specified in the rental agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Permission to house pets:</strong> Some folks are averse
              to the idea of animals inside their houses. If you have such an
              aversion, the tenant must be notified about it through the
              contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Consequences of overstay:</strong> Should the tenant
              continue to occupy the premises even after the term of the lease
              is up, the Landlord is free to charge a penalty which was agreed
              upon in writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Consequences of late payments:</strong> If the tenant
              fails to pay rent before the stipulated date, the penalty for the
              same must be spelled out in the contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Food habits:</strong> If you are a landlord who does not
              wish to encourage consumption of non-vegetarian food/alcohol/
              other edible items of your choice, it shall be explicitly
              mentioned in the contract.

                While it is not very common, people could be tricked while
                taking part in a rental transaction. Cases of caretakers posing
                as the landlord, giving the house to multiple tenants, etc are
                some such incidents. To avoid potential tricksters, here are
                some things you could do-
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Owner’s authenticity: </strong>Ask for documents that
                  can attest to the fact that the guy posing as the landlord is
                  indeed the landlord.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Payment receipts: </strong>Insist on getting back
                  receipts for every payment you make.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Deductions from security deposit: </strong>At the time
                  of vacating, the landlord is expected to return your security
                  deposit to you after making the necessary deductions. It is
                  your job to ask a detailed description about how much was
                  deducted for what.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Agreement registration:</strong>
                  If you skip registration and a legal battle ensues, the court
                  will never consider your rental agreement as primary evidence.
                  An unregistered contract is only seen as collateral evidence.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p style={{ margin: "2em 0" }}>
                <strong>Security Deposit </strong>– This is a few months worth
                of rent collected in advance from the tenant. At the end of the
                term, the landlord is expected to return this money to the
                tenant after making deductions for regular maintenance. In West
                Bengal, 2-3 months worth of rent is typically collected as a
                security deposit.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
                <strong>Token Advance </strong>– This is a very small sum of
                money collected by the landlord from the tenant with the
                intention of booking his property for the tenant and preventing
                other potential tenants from developing an interest. Once the
                token advance is paid, the deal is considered final. If either
                party backs out, he/she should compensate for the losses
                incurred by the other party. In most cases, the token advance is
                not refunded.
