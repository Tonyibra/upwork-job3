					<div className="pList">
						<p>
							Talking about how to create a rental agreement so it would
							generally involve all the things which are already discussed
							between a landlord and the tenant. Both the parties just need to
							go to the lawyer for drafting of their agreement. After drafting
							comes the stamp duty and registration which is generally taken
							care by the lawyer only and if we try to get it done then it would
							require a lot of time and efforts too and the charges may also

						<span>What Are E Stamp Paper Requirements</span>
					</div>
					<div className="pList">
						<p>
							E Stamp paper is a kind of paper duty which is imposed on several
							documents to make them legally valid. In different states the
							stamp duty imposed on rental agreement differs so talking about
							stamp duty which is imposed in West Bengal is 4% of the whole
							amount paid and 6% of the consideration of twice the amount or
							value of average annual rent. In West Bengal e-stamping facilities
							were introduced in 2012. The state is still planning to entirely
							switch to e-stamping which means both e-stamp paper and
							conventional stamp paper are currently in use.

						<span>What Is Meant By Registration Of Rental Agreement</span>
					</div>
					<div className="pList">
						<p>
							By registering a document it means to check whether the agreement
							which is prepared is authentic or not, the details provided are
							correct or not. It also reveals all the matters related to the
							property under registration. Registration looks into the matter
							that all the details provided by the party belongs to him/her or
							is it some sort of forgery. If during the registration process any
							such problem arises and the registration is overlooked then the
							document would never be considered valid evidence in court of law
							it will always be considered as a collateral evidence. So it is
							very important to take charge of the proper registration process.
						</p>
						<p>
							The registration charges are to be paid in the sub registrar
							office and the charges of registration may also vary like that of
							stamp duty does state wise and also according to each year’s rule
							of stamp act by the respective state governments.

						<span>How Many Types Of Rental Agreements Are There</span>
					</div>
					<div className="pList">
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							So mainly there are three types of rental agreement which are
							discussed below:-
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em", padding: "0px 0px 0px 40px" }}>
							<ul>
								<li>11-Month Rental Agreement</li>
								<li>Long Term Lease</li>
								<li>Commercial Lease</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							<strong>11-Month Rental Agreement</strong> – This is the most
							commonly used rental agreement throughout the country as this
							agreement is pretty simple to understand and can be easily
							exercised too.
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							This kind of agreement does not involve notarization or
							registration, this one as the name suggests is a simple 11 months
							agreement between the landlord and the tenant and it would expire
							after completion of 11 months
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							<strong>Long Term Lease</strong> – Now talking about the Long term
							lease so this type of agreement is not so commonly used agreement
							as compared to the 11 month rental agreement. This kind of
							agreement lasts for years and it is more often used for
							residential purposes. This type of agreement involves a huge sum
							of money in the beginning only and once the agreement comes to an
							end the money is returned to the tenant.
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.3em" }}>
							<strong>Commercial Lease</strong> – This is a type of agreement
							which is specially made for commercial purposes only and here a
							huge amount of money is required in the beginning and the tenure
							is also long. This type of agreement usually doesn’t require so
							much of paper work as compared to the other two agreement and the
							formalities which are required to be fulfilled vary according to
							the type of commercial activity.

							What Are The Important Clauses To Include In Your Rental Agreement
						</span>
					</div>
					<div className="pList">
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							Clauses are basically a few conditions which are laid down by the
							Landlord before the contract starts. It is very necessary to
							disclose various important clauses which are to be mentioned in
							the agreement in order to avoid future disputes.
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							Some of the important clauses are:-
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
							<strong>
								Most important clause is the clause in which Monthly rent,
								maintenance charge and the security deposit is mentioned.
							</strong>
							This clause carries utmost importance which can avoid so many
							disputes, this clause should come along with the frequency of
							payment too.
						</p>
						<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.3em" }}>
							<strong>Lock in Period–</strong>This is mainly a time period
							before which a tenant can not vacate the house. This lock-in
							period is mainly made to safeguard the interests of a landlord
							which means that if the tenant rents a property and just after
							moving in the house says that i’ll vacant the house in a day which
							would definitely incur loss to the landlord so to ensure no loss
							to the landlord this thing came into existence.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Permission to allow pets–</strong>There are various people
							who don’t really like pets or maybe don’t prefer them getting at
							their place so it is again very important for the tenant to know
							whether his/her landlord allows pets or not.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Consequences of overstay–</strong>Overstay basically means
							that if a tenant stays in the landlord’s property even after the
							completion of the lease then the tenant would have to pay a
							certain penalty, whatever is mentioned in the contract already by
							the landlord.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Consequences of late payments–</strong> If the tenant
							fails to pay the rent on the agreed date then on that condition
							the landlord would charge a penalty whatever is pre mentioned in
							the contract.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Food Habits–</strong>This is also again a very important
							thing which is to be mentioned. This says that if the landlord
							doesn’t like things like non-vegetarian items, alcohol should be
							made or consumed in the property then this should be mentioned in
							the contract clearly that these things are strictly prohibited and
							if it is still done then action would be taken as per the
							contract.

								What Are Things Which Are To Be Kept In Mind While Renting
							</span>
						</div>
						<div className="pList">
							<p style={{ marginBottom: "2em" }}>
								Now while you’re getting into a contract it is pretty essential
								that you check the authenticity of your landlord so it is not
								very common but sometimes it does happen that the the person who
								is claiming to be the landlord (owner of the property) might
								just be the caretaker of the property and fooling you. So some
								of the important things which are to be checked are mentioned
								below:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Owner’s authenticity –</strong>Now this is something
									which is very important for the tenant to know that the person
									whom the tenant is thinking to be a landlord is actually a
									landlord is just posing to be one. The tenant can ask for
									anything which can prove their ownership.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Payment receipts –</strong>It is very important on the
									part of a tenant to ask for receipt on every payment made by
									him/her every month as monthly rent. Deductions from security
									deposit: Once the tenant is vacating the property and the
									landlord returns the security deposit after doing the
									necessary deduction it is very important for the tenant to ask
									for a detailed description of all the deductions made in from
									the security money.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Agreement registration –</strong>If you are into a
									long term lease or commercial lease and skip registration and
									a legal battle ensues then the court will never consider your
									rental agreement as primary evidence. An unregistered contract
									is only considered as collateral evidence only.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Security Deposit –</strong>
									Security deposit is a type of deposit which is collected from
									the tenant at the time of moving in the property only, it is a
									type of advance payment made by the tenant to the landlord and
									once the lease gets over the landlord is supposed to return
									the security deposit after making deductions of maintenance .
									In West Bengal, 2-3 months worth of rent is typically
									collected as a security deposit.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p style={{ margin: "2em 0" }}>
								<strong>Token Advance – </strong>This is a very small amount of
								money which is taken by the landlord from the tenant to lock the
								deal for that particular person and also makes other interested
								parties show that the specific property is not available for
								rent once the token money is received. If any one party backs
								out he/she will have to compensate for the loss which occurred
								by the other party. Usually token advance is not refunded.
